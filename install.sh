#   AWCP_VERSION   Version to install, in the pattern x.y.z. Required.
#   AWCP_BASE_URL  Artifact host.
#   AWCP_REPO_URL  Repository the configuration directory is fetched from.
#
# Everything runs from main, called on the last line, so a download truncated
# mid-transfer can't execute a partial install.
