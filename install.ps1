.SYNOPSIS
    Bootstrap installer for the AWS Workload Credentials Provider on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    Downloads the release binary and the matching configuration directory, then
    runs install.ps1 from it.

    The version is explicit: the binary comes from the artifact host and the
    service units and install scripts come from the repository at tag v<Version>,
    so both halves are pinned to the same release.

    The binary's Authenticode signature is verified before anything is
    installed. It covers the binary only: the service registration and install
    scripts come from the tag archive over TLS, with no signature of their own.

.PARAMETER Version
    Version to install, in the pattern x.y.z. Defaults to $env:AWCP_VERSION.

.PARAMETER Config
    Bootstrap config passed through to install.ps1.

.PARAMETER NoStart
    Install and register services but don't start them.

.PARAMETER Force
    Stop running provider services before installing.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Download and verify, then stop without installing.

.EXAMPLE
    $installer = Join-Path $env:TEMP "awcp-install.ps1"
    Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/aws-workload-credentials-provider/HEAD/install.ps1 -OutFile $installer
    & $installer -Version 3.1.1 -Config C:\path\to\config.toml

    Downloaded to a file rather than run from the response, because
    [scriptblock]::Create() on an empty body silently does nothing and reports
    success, so a failed download would read as a completed install.
